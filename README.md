# Stocks-Analysis On Green Energy Company's
## **A Quick Overview**
 **Steve** ,*a recent college graduate recently came to us so we can help him and his parent's look into inevsting into* **"green energy company's"**. ***Steve's** parent's are decinding to invest a huge sum of money into "**DAQO**". **Steve** wants us to help them divided up that money to invest into other **"green energy company's"** similar to "**DAQO**". The purpose of this project is to create a **VBA Script** to be able to analyze **"green energy"** stock's for **Steve's** Parent's. However, also creating a **VBA Script** that runs more efficently that can be reused for a large sum of stock's.*
## **Result's** ##
Comparing "**DAQO**" return's from  **2017** and **2018**. "**DAQO**" isn't the right invesment **Steve's** parent's should invest in. Although in **2017** **DAQO** had a succesful year coming in at **("199.4%")** return . In **2018** **DAQO** had a signifciant loss of **("-62.2%")** in stock's.

Based on my analysis and research . I would highly recommened **Steve's** parent's not to invest in **DAQO** . Although most of the stock's we analyzed including **DAQO** didn't thrive in **2018** in particular there were two stock's or **"green energy company's"** that profited throughout the year and prospered in return's. In **2018** **"ENPH"** return's were **("81.9%")** and **RUN** return's were **("84%")**. These two stock's are worth investing.

 Overall **refactoring** our *VBA Script/Code* will compile the results more efficently and effectively . In simpler terms our refactored *VBA Code* execute's at a much rapid rate compared to the *Original Script* that took a bit longer to compile.



## **Summary**
*What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?*
### ***Advantages*** ###
- Refactoring the **code** help's us comprehend and understand the **code** better, But not only understand it we can find **bug's** within the **code** and fix them. 
- Also refactoring the **code** clean's up the overview look of our script and helps the **code** run more efficently .
### ***Disadvantages*** ###
- Refactoring the **code** could be too time consuming due to sum of the new **code's** creating new bug's.
- Adding on to my previous statement about "**Time Consuming**". What if your job give's you a deadline that you must complete with in hour's this could set you back hour's. Plus why ? should a **code** that is running perfectly fine be refactored. In my opinion you should only be refactoring a code if you have plenty of time on your hands and if your job require's you to .
### ***How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?*** ###
In Conclusion, based on my expierence theres a bit of time difference between starting a script from scratch to refactoring it. Refactoring a script takes up more time due to formatting, Comment's , and creating better **if**-statement's to equation's . Refactoring the **code** may create new bugs where they weren't previously exsisting but refactoring the **code** those execute the script swiftly .
